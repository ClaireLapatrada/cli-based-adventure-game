You are in a dimly lit room with a glimmering vending machine as the focal point.
You find yourself in a dark room, the only source of light emanating from a strangely
attractive vending machine that glimmers in the corner. The room feels confined,
with no visible exits or windows. The door you entered through now seems permanently locked,
effectively cutting off any retreat. The vending machine, with its soft humming and flickering lights,
beckons you closer, casting an eerie glow in the otherwise pitch-black environment.
It's unclear what secrets this machine holds, but it seems to be your only point of interaction in this enigmatic space.

A hallway full of paintings in Hart House.
As you step into the hallway, a surreal silence envelops you.
The walls are adorned with various paintings, each one seemingly alive in the dim light of dawn.
There's no one around, yet you hear faint whispers, as if the painted figures are conversing in hushed tones.
Could talking to the paintings provide clue for your next adventure?
