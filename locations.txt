You are in a dimly lit room with a glimmering vending machine as the focal point.
You find yourself in a dark room, the only source of light emanating from a strangely
attractive vending machine that glimmers in the corner. The room feels confined,
with no visible exits or windows. The door you entered through now seems permanently locked,
effectively cutting off any retreat. The vending machine, with its soft humming and flickering lights,
beckons you closer, casting an eerie glow in the otherwise pitch-black environment.
It's unclear what secrets this machine holds, but it seems to be your only point of interaction in this enigmatic space.

You are in a hallway full of paintings in Hart House.
As you step into the hallway, a surreal silence envelops you.
The walls are adorned with various paintings, each one seemingly alive in the dim light of dawn.
There's no one around, yet you hear faint whispers, as if the painted figures are conversing in hushed tones.
Could talking to the paintings provide clue for your next adventure?

You are at the heart of Queen’s Park.
You wander into the dawn of Queen's Park where trees wear glistening snow like delicate jewels.
The majestic horse statue stands prominent amidst the tranquil surroundings.
You sensed a bond with the horse statue, as if it possessed an intriguing allure that drew you in.
It felt as though the gaze of the horse statue locked onto yours,
establishing a silent connection between you and the majestic sculpture.
Maybe you should look around the statue. What might the horse statue be seeking from you?

You are at the infamous McLennan Physics Lab.
Guided by your trusty horse, you reached a tall 14-story building tucked away in the quiet corner of the campus
– the McLennan Physics Lab. You remembered that letter covered in stars you've been carrying.
It felt like the right time to see if it had any clues. As you entered,
the massive doors hinted at the mysteries inside. The night held promise,
and maybe those words on the letter had something to reveal in the quiet halls of the McLennan Physics Lab.
Oh, there's a telescope on the rooftop of McLennan. Does it have something to do with the letter?
Maybe let's TAKE THE ELEVATOR on the right.
